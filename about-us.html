                    Born in Pefki, Attica, Greece in 2001, Dimitrios Tsirmpas is the main Founder of Faymetrics.
                    He is an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the Athens University
                    of Economics and Business. He has an average grade of 9.04/10 and has received a scholarship
                    from Huawei (even though he still can't properly write SQL Queries). He founded the company
                    Faymetrics one night after awakening from his long slumber where he had seen a vision of a great
                    world with even greater meteorology devices.
