                        Born in Pefki, Attica, Greece in 2001, Dimitrios Tsirmpas is the main Founder of Faymetrics.
                        He is an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the Athens University
                        of Economics and Business. He has an average grade of 9.04/10 and has received a scholarship
                        from Huawei (even though he still can't properly write SQL Queries). He founded the company
                        Faymetrics one night after awakening from his long slumber where he had seen a vision of a great
                        world with even greater meteorology devices.
