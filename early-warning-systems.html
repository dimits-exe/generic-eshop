                Early Warning Systems
            </h2>
            <p>
                In Faymetrics we have strived towards developing the cutting edge technologies regarding
                systems designed to warn users about extreme weather effects, such as wildfires, storms,
                dust storms, volcanic ash distribution and many more. These machines help their owners by
                significantly reducing costs and time consumed regarding extreme weather detection.

            <h2>What does an Early warning system do? </h2>
            <p>
                Early warning information are standardised messages (signs, words, sound or images) that announce an
                imminent danger, e.g. from natural hazards. Heavy rain early warning information is dealing with the
                eponymous natural hazard “heavy rain”. Information is provided by higher authorities, regional or
                national institutions.

                But early warning information itself does not keep hazards from turning into disasters. It needs entire
                EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS for enabling individuals at-risk, communities and organisations to prepare and act
                appropriately – in advance and during impending hazard events.

            <h2>Use Cases</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>Local Administration</h3>
                <p>
                    Within an early warning system, the core role of the local administration or competent authority is
                    to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Built-up sufficient response capabilities for the area,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strengthen the capacity of individuals’ at-risk and other local key actors to receive, analyse
                        and
                        act-on incoming warnings,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enhance/complement existing early warning systems by local data,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improve existing early warning systems by feedback to system developers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In most countries of Central Europe, municipal personnel are a key actor for heavy rain early
                    warning systems. They are the living link between incoming early warning information and local
                    action (e.g. when mobilising emergency response). It is their task to know how to access and
                    interpret warning information and how to organise dissemination and adequate action in advance.

                <h3>Private Use</h3>
                <p>
                    Private persons are recipients and end users of early warning information. They need to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Be aware of the natural hazard heavy rain and know their individual risk which is dependent not
                        only from the rainfall but also from local conditions and from their and their families'
                        vulnerability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rely on and use the early warning information provided by competent authorities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built-up capacities to receive, to analyse and to act-on early warning information.

                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>By the level at which it is operated</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community or people-centred early warning systems, operated at a more locallevel by a municipal
                        government or a community. The most typical systems of this kind address flood.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        National early warning systems operated by a national-level government agency like a
                        meteorological department, a geological observatory or institute, a health or an agricultural
                        ministry.
                    </li>

                    <li>
