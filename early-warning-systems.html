                In Faymetrics we have strived towards developing the cutting edge technologies regarding
                systems designed to warn users about extreme weather effects, such as wildfires, storms,
                dust storms, volcanic ash distribution and many more. These machines help their owners by
                significantly reducing costs and time consumed regarding extreme weather detection.

            <h2>What does an Early warning system do? </h2>
            <p class="text-intro">
                Early warning information are standardised messages (signs, words, sound or images) that announce an
                imminent danger, e.g. from natural hazards. Heavy rain early warning information is dealing with the
                eponymous natural hazard <em>“heavy rain”</em>. Information is provided by higher authorities, regional
                or
                national institutions.

                But early warning information itself does not keep hazards from turning into disasters. It needs entire
                early warning systems for enabling individuals at-risk, communities and organisations
                to prepare and act
                appropriately – in advance and during impending hazard events.

            <h2>Types of EAS at the level at which they are operated</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <em>Community</em> or people-centred early warning systems, operated at a more locallevel by a
                    municipal
                    government or a community. The most typical systems of this kind address flood.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>National</em> early warning systems operated by a national-level government agency like a
                    meteorological department, a geological observatory or institute, a health or an agricultural
                    ministry.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Regional systems operated at a more regional level. Two examples in this category are the <a
                        href="http://fews.net/">Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET)</a> operated by the
                    United States of America in various regions of the world and the <a

                </li>

                <li>
                    Global systems operated at the international level by international organizations like the WHO

                        Croatian Waters receives data from the DHMZ about the forecasted precipitation through the ALADINHR4
                        model. It covers forecasted precipitation (rain, snow, total), temperature, humidity, wind and cloud
                        cover in a 4×4 km grid, and is available for 72 hours in advance. The file format is ASCII. In
                        addition to that, data from the global ECMWF model is also received through DHMZ (the same
                        parameters).

                        FeWIS is an information platform with limited access mainly for civil protection units (e.g. fire
                        brigades). Through FeWIS, users are provided with current weather information, weather warnings and
                        current radar derived precipitation data as well as short time radar-based forecasts (via the storm
                        cell identification and tracking method KONRAD). Furthermore, FeWIS informs also about the current
                        wild fire risk and about pollutant dispersion in the air in case of an accident.

                        In one glance you will be able to see on an overview map where in Europe the weather might become
                        dangerous. The colours used on the maps on the website indicate the severity of the danger and its
                        possible impact in four warning levels (green, yellow, orange, red). On the European map each
                        participating country is coloured consistent with the highest colour assigned to a current warning.
                        Clicking on a country will link you to national and regional warnings. Additionally a RSS feed gives
                        the opportunity to subscribe and to customize the information stream.
